# TechConnect

TechConnect is a platform designed to empower local electronics vendors by providing an online marketplace to showcase and sell their products. The platform aims to bridge the gap between customers and vendors, ensuring quick issue resolution and personalized service.

## Features
- Browse and purchase electronics directly from local vendors.
- Easy vendor registration and product listing.
- Real-time product updates and user authentication.

## Motivation
The rise of online marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart has negatively impacted local vendors. These platforms often delay issue resolution and lack direct accountability. TechConnect was built to address these challenges and provide a more personal shopping experience.

## Technologies used
- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **Backend**: Firebase (Database and Authentication)

## Key Contributions
- Developed the frontend interface using ReactJS to ensure a seamless user experience.
- Utilized Firebase to store and manage vendor and product details.
- Modularized data handling to enhance scalability and maintainability.

## Challenges Faced
- Managing and structuring data effectively on Firebase.
- Modularizing the data system for smoother integration across various components.

## Skills Learned
- Proficient in ReactJS for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- Understanding Firebase database management and authentication.
- Learning efficient data flow management within ReactJS.






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
